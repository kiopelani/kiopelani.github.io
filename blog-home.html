           My Thinking Style

        <p>Before we began Phase 0, we all had to take a test to determine what our Gregorian Thinking Style was.  Mine was Abstract Random -- I read through the characteristics, then quickly forgot about them. Revisiting them now, however, I've realized that a lot of the things I've found difficult in Phase 0 so far directly relate to my thinking style, and I can use that knowledge now to improve my learning strategies.
          <p>
          First of all, abstract random thinkers learn best in a personalized environment where we can work on cooperative assignments with other people and learn from discussion. Since Phase 0 is done remotely, the lack of face to face time with others while learning has been especially difficult for me, but thankfully we have the pairing sessions, which gives us an opportunity for collaboration. So the more pairing the better for me! Also, to achieve a more personalized environment, it would be a good idea for me to go to office hours more often (I have yet to do it!).
          <p>
          Another abstract random thinker trait I've had problems with is that we don't like to explain or justify feelings, so having to write public reflections on a regular basis is definitely difficult for me. But by forcing myself to do it often, I believe it will gradually become easier for me (it already has!).
          <p>
          So I've got some things to work on, but knowing specifically what areas I need to target is the first step towards making changes!
