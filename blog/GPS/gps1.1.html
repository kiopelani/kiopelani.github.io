            <h4>What is pair programming?</h4><p></p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Pair programming is when you are working together to create a single project with someone else.
            You are both working on the same code.</p>

            <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
            </p>
            <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Phase-0, it is important to not only code together, but to also get to know your fellow boots.
            It is great for improving your communcation skills and getting each other out of our comfort zones.

            <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver focuses on the task at hand and translates what the navigator says into code, while the navigator is the one who is talking through the process.
            This doesn't mean the driver is silent -- there should be open communication between the two of them.

        <strong>Reflection</strong>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 5px 0 5px">
          I survived pairing for the first time! Hooray! This was the first time I've actually used Stypi with someone, and that definitely made the experience much easier than just working with screen sharing. I think my partner was very good at communicating clearly, so that definitely worked well, and I was glad that the instructor was there to provide extra help when necessary!
