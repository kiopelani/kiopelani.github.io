           CSS: Classes vs IDs
        </div>

        <p> One of the most confusing aspects of learning CSS has been when to use classes and when to use ids.  The general rule of thumb seems to be that ids are for elements that will only appear on a page once, while classes are for elements that will occur multiple times. But the difference between the two, and when to use them, is a bit more complex than that.
          <p>
          First of all, it is possible for a single element to have both a class and an id at the same time.  In fact, an element can have as many classes as you want, but it can only have one unique id.  For example, let's say we wanted to represent my vegetable garden in html.  It might look a little something like this:
          <img src="images/garden.png" alt="garden-code">
          <p>
          In this, my divs "starsky" and "hutch" both have all the properties of the tomato class and the vegetable class, but they also have unique properties associated only with their ids.
          <p>
          Another important difference beween ids and classes is that a browser can automatically scroll to an id element, while it cannot do the same with a class. For example, clicking on a link to #starsky would take you directly to my starsky div on the page.  If you tried to link to .vegetable, however, the browser wouldn't know which instance of the class vegetable to go to.  So, if you want to create a link directly to an element on the page, that element should have an id.
