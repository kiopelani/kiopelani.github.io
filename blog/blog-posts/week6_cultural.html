        Stereotype Threat is when a person consciously or subconsciously feels anxiety about being judged in a stereotypical way, and that anxiety affects their performance of a particular task in a negative way.
        <p>The most talked about example of this is a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">study</a> that showed black student performed more poorly on tests when thoughts of black vs white intelligence stereotypes were triggered. But stereotype threat isn't exclusively tied to racial stereotypes  -- it can be triggered by male/female stereotypes, socioeconomic stereotypes, body stereotypes, and pretty much any kind of stereotype you can think of.
        <p>
        I know for me, as I've begun this Dev Bootcamp journey, I've reflected quite a bit on why I never considered being a Computer Science Major in college. I took a CS class and liked it, but why did I never seriously consider it as a possibility? The answer is stereotype threat.
        <p>
        I had been an "artsy" kid since the beginning of high school, and that was a huge part of my identity.  Unfortunately, being an artsy kid comes with the belief that you must be bad at math and science.  I wasn't bad at math or science, but since I went to an arts high school, where the belief that we were all bad at math and science was extremely prevalent, I eventually came to believe that I was too.  And that carried over to college -- I was convinced that I belonged in the art sphere, and that I would never be able to keep up in a major as "techy" as CS. So I stayed away.
        <p>
        Stereotype threat has many consequences -- it can make people believe they are incapable of doing something that they may actually be great at.  A stereotype threat study that gave black and white students GRE problems to solve gave one group of black students the test under the pre-text that it was measuring intelligence, while another group of black students were told it was just for fun.  Those who were told it was just for fun performed just as well as white students, while those who were told it was for intelligence performed significantly worse.
        <p> Based on this study then, perhaps an effective way to help combat stereotype threat in an academic setting would be to frame academic material in a more casual, non-judgmental way, which would allow students to gravitate towards what they naturally like. It won't solve every stereotype threat problem, but it would be a start.
