          Maintaining a website requires constant change. The more I learn, the more I'm able to improve my site. As a result, the look of my site has changed quite drastically from it's first incarnation (which involved a lot of purple and ugly fonts).
          <p>
          The latest update to my site was a bit more behind the scenes though, as I recently upgraded the look of my site. In this revamp, I significantly reworked my CSS and HTML files to make them more efficient/concise/just easier to understand in general.
          <p>
          In maintaining my site thus far, I'd noticed a number of things that made it difficult/time consuming for me to make changes:
          <p> 1. The id and class names I had chosen for my divs in CSS weren't obvious as to what the contained. Therefore, I wasted a lot of time just trying to figure out what divs were where.
          <p>2. I wasn't consistent with how I styled HTML elements. I mostly used a separate CSS stylesheet to control the look, but sometimes I made the changes within the HTML document to individual elements. This made it difficult to control the style of elements.
          <p>3. My CSS indentation/organization didn't make a whole lot of sense and was difficult to read.
          <p>
          After going back and fixing these three problems, my HTML files and CSS stylesheets were much easier to follow! So I will have to keep those three potential problem areas in mind whenever designing any future web pages.
