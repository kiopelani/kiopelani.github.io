           Databases: SQL vs NoSQL

         There are two types of databases that Ruby beginners like me should know about: SQL and NoSQL databases, or more correctly distinguished as Relational vs Non-Relational Databases.
          <p>
          Relational Databases, are the traditional/most popular type of database. They are highly structured and use a standard method of organization to store data, called schemas, which are tables with columns. All relational databases use the language SQL to create, read, update, and delete data. Examples of SQL database managements systems are: Oracle, MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server.
          <p>
          Non-Relational Databases, on the other hand, are the new cool kids on the block. They have no standard structure or standard language, and frequently store use documents to store single data sets. Examples of NoSQL database managements systems are: MongoDB, CouchDB.
          <p>
          Non-Relational Databases allow for more flexibility and customization -- instead of storing all data in tables, you could instead store data in many documents, or in a hash key/value style relationship.
          <p>One of the most commonly cited drawbacks of Relational Databases is that if you have a high volume of user interacting with your database (and by high I mean millions of users at once) and a vast amount of data stored in your database, then Relational Databases can be extremely slow.  But unless you are Google or Amazon (they both use non-relational databases), a relational database will probably work just fine for you.
          <p>Another benefit of Relational Databases is that they have been around longer and are in wider use than Non-Relational Databases, so they have a greater support network.
          <p>For me personally, I find Relational Databases more appealing.  They have a structure and an order that makes sense to me. But perhaps I will change my mind once I actually starting working with Non-Relational Databases.
