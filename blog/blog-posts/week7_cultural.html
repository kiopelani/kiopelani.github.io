              DBC asked us to do an unusual assignment this week -- think about our happiest moments in life, then, given a list of words/phrases, pick which words applied to these moments.  For me, I ended up with a list of about 10 words, ranging from "accomplishment" to "music", but the phrase that stood out most to me, the one that applied to <em>all</em> of my happiest moments, was "close relationships".
              <p>
              When I was working in entertainment, everyone was very upfront about how crucial your 'network' (your useful work-related relationships) was to your success. In entertainment, the strength and quantity of your relationships directly related to how well you could do your work, and the quality of those relationships determined how happy you were.

              <p>Having good relationships isn't just important in entertainment though.  In any job, having positive relationships with your co-workers means you will be able to work well together on projects and function in a more positive work environment in general. Having good relationships in your personal life as well means you have other people to experience life with, which generally contributes to happiness.
              <p>
              I had to laugh when I got to the next part of our DBC assignment, which asked us what the last topic was that someone asked you for advice on. Of course, it was relationships. No wonder that topic resonated so strongly with me when I saw it on the list! In fact, thinking back on when people come to me for advice, it's almost always about some kind of relationship -- be it a boyfriend, girlfriend, coworker, roommate, or family member. Clearly, maintaining positive relationships across all aspects of our lives matters a great deal to people.
              <p>So -- conclusions? The key to success <em>and</em> happiness in any career (and in life in general, I'm convinced) is maintaining positive relationships with the people around us.  Therefore, I'll be going into DBC with the goal of building and maintaining as many positive relationships as possible.
