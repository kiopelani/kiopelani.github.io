          When I first started out on this Dev Bootcamp journey, I knew we were going to be learning Ruby on Rails, but (I'm rather embarrassed to admit) I didn't really understand what Rails was. Sure, I knew it was something that used the programming language Ruby to build web applications, but what kind of a 'something' was Rails? Was it another language? A program? A school of thought? Well that's the question I'm going to answer for you today!

          <p>
          <strong>Basics First -- What Is Rails?</strong><p>
          If you want a highly detailed explanation of Rails, I suggest you read Daniel Kehoe's explanation <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html">here</a>. If you're looking for a simpler explanation, however, stick with me.
          <p>To answer the question "What Is Rails?", you might first turn to Wikipedia (as I did) and wind up with this definition:
          <p><em> "Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is an open source web application framework written in Ruby."</em>
          <p>
          For those not fluent in tech speak, here's my translation:
          <p><em>Rails, a piece of software that anyone can use/make changes to, uses Ruby, a programming language, to simplify the process of creating complex web sites.</em>
          <p>
          If you want to get even more specific about what Rails <em>is</em>, Rails is actually a Ruby Gem.  For those of you not too familiar with Ruby, a gem is Ruby's name for a software package. Software packages are kind of like accessories for a bike -- if you add a horn or a jet pack, your bike will be able to warn people of its approach or fly (or maybe just go very very fast). Bottom-line: gems are extra pieces of software that give Ruby new/enhanced abilities.
          <p>
          <strong>What Does Rails Do?</strong>
          <p>Okay -- so Rails is a software package that makes it easier/more efficient to build web applications with the programming language Ruby. But exactly how does Rails do that?
          <p>
          In the most simplistic terms, Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce web applications that run on a web server.
          <p>Rails does this by using a set of established conventions that automatically decide how the "low-level" details of development should be handled. For example, if you create an object in Rails called "user", Rails will automatically save data for that object to a database table named "users", so you don't have to do it yourself. This saves the developer time and allows them to focus on more important aspects of the software instead.
          <p>
          <strong>Why Should I Learn Rails?</strong><p>
          So you know what Rails is and have a general idea of what it does, but why should you learn Rails instead of some other web application framework? Here are just a few reasons why developers like Rails so much:
          <p>
          ---Rails is easy (relatively).  Because Rails streamlines the development process by automating the more tedious aspects of programming, web application development is simplified.
          <p>
          ---Rails is fast. Because there are a vast number of Ruby Gems available that can be used with Ruby (and Rails) to enhance the language, applications can be developed at a very fast pace. Start-Ups in particular love Rails for its ability to quickly launch complex sites.
          <p>
          ---Rails is collaborative. Because Rails uses fairly rigid conventions to create applications, Rails developers can easily recognize/understand how a Rails application is structured.  This makes it easy for developers to build and maintain Rails-built web applications.
          <p>
          So what are you waiting for? Get out there and learn Rails!
