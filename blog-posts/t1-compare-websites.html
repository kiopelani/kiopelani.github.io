<h3><em>For our technical blog post this week, I took a closer look at these three very different websites to compare their user experience and design.</em></h3>
<p>
<h2>1. BBC WORLD NEWS: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world/">http://www.bbc.com/news/world/</a></h2>
This is one of my favorite sites because it does a great job of delivering breaking news  content.  The news articles range from silly to serious, but the homepage makes it extremely easy to tell at a glance what the top stories are currently.  The more important the story, the larger the headline and image appear.  There is a big red navigation bar that consistently appears on every page throughout the site, so it’s very easy to find your way around.  Images and links on the page frequently change, giving the appearance that the site is constantly updating and evolving.
<p>
Overall, the layout is extremely neat, clean, and easy to navigate.
<p>
<h2>2. THE SARTORIALIST: <a href="http://www.thesartorialist.com">http://www.thesartorialist.com</a></h2>
The Sartorialist is a fashion/photograph blog that I absolutely adore.  The site is very minimal in design, with a huge logo plastered across the top as a header, a simple navigation bar right beneath it, and then the blog posts below.  Since this is a photography blog, the background is simple black and white, making the photos the main visual elements here.
<p>
Overall, the layout is sleek and minimalist (not surprising for an art blog that doesn’t expect its users to do much more than scroll through pretty pictures).
<p>
<h2>3. WHOLE FOODS: <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com">http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com</a></h2>
I only use the Whole Foods website for their recipe section, since I actually find their website a bit confusing in general.  They have a menu navigation bar that pops out from the side if you click on it on every page, but the home page isn’t laid out in a way that makes it easy to understand what features are available on the site.  The site is extremely colorful though, and the gigantic pictures of food that make up the background for most of the pages always make me feel hungry (which is probably the intent).
<p>
Overall, the design is a bit cluttered/disorganized, but the bright color scheme and use of food photos makes the site feel quite cheerful.
