               <p> Well, watching Shreef&rsquo;s fireside chat simultaneously managed to terrify me and reassure me that everything is going to be great.  Terrified, because it confirmed my expectation that at DBC, I will probably be working harder than I have ever worked before (and I used to work an 8-11pm job!), but reassured because Shreef constantly reminded us that this is a group experience and we&rsquo;re all in this together.
              </p>
              <p><em>&quot;This is a team sport&quot;</em><br>
              This was probably the most important take away for me from the entire video. Learning how to work socially and learn from others is one of the most important factors and succeeding at DBC.  I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about that before, but I&rsquo;m excited and can&rsquo;t wait to be inspired by my fellow cohort mates.
              </p>

              <p><em>&quot;Being a developer involves reading code more than writing code.&quot;</em><br>
              This was completely eye opening for me, but once Shreef said it, it made so much sense.  I&rsquo;ve already learned a tremendous amount just from looking at other people&rsquo;s solutions to the challenges, and will keep up the habit!
              </p>
              <p>
              Overall, I&rsquo;m still a little nervous about DBC, but I&rsquo;m so excited to learn from our instructors and (perhaps more importantly) from each other.
