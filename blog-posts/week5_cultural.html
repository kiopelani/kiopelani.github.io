          When you're learning a new language, pairing on a project can be kind of scary. It's what I imagine trying to jointly write an essay in Latin with someone must feel like after you're both only a few weeks into your intro class.
          <p>

          You're going to be nervous. You're going to be confused. But you're also going to learn something new along the way!
          <p>
          One of the many new things I've learned so far is this simple formula: <strong>good pairing = good sharing.</strong>
          <p> There was a saying that we all lived by at my old job -- <em>assumptions are the mother of all f***ups</em>. And that applies surprisingly well to pairing. If you are even the slightest bit unsure about something, ask!
          <p>Maybe you think you understand what the difference between public and private methods are. Look it up. Maybe you think your partner has the same definitions for "driver" and "navigator" that you do. Ask them. The clearer the communication, the better the pairing.
          <p>
          I didn't come up with this entirely on my own though -- it's something that gets regularly reflected in the feedback I read each week. Reading feedback is honestly one of the best parts of this learning process -- the anonymous aspect means people actually give genuine responses, so you know what you're doing right and what you need to work on.
          <p>The most difficult part of writing feedback for me is coming up with something actionable for everyone -- I've gotten many good actionable feedback suggestions from others, so I hope that one day I'll be just as helpful as them! One thing in particular that I really want to work (based on actionable feedback) is being more confident in suggesting an alternative approach to a problem, and discussing what the pros and cons of that might be. And really that's just a more specific example of my highly scientific formula: <strong>good pairing = good sharing.</strong>
