          This week we spent some time researching ways to handle conflict and encountered something known as the Compass of Shame. The Compass of Shame is made up of four different ways most people handle conflict -- withdrawal, attack self, avoidance, or attack other.
          <p>Personally I hate any and all forms of conflict, so my instincts usually lead me to use withdrawal or avoidance. Self attack gets used occasionally, but I very rarely use attack other. In fact, I can only remember using it once, long ago on a crisp 90s autumn day in Ms. D's third grade class...
          <p>
          I had just seen the boy I regularly referred to as my future husband flirting with another girl, and my little ten-year-old self was furious! Rather than crying about it in a corner like most little girls my age would do, I went right up to him and said, "I hate you!"
          <p>
          This caused the boy to promptly burst into tears, and I instantly felt horrible about what I'd just done.  But it was too late to take it back -- the teacher was already standing over us, and when she kindly asked why on earth I had felt the need to say such an awful thing to another student, I couldn't bring myself to say, "I felt really hurt so I lashed out and said something mean". Instead I just hung my head in shame and said I was sorry. I still ended up getting "benched" though, which meant I had to sit on the bench of shame (it was actually called that) during lunch and watch everyone else run amuck on the playground without me. For any third grader, it was the ultimate form of humiliation.
          <p>
          But it was also a valuable learning experience for me. Not only did I learn that attacking others was <em>not</em> an effective way to handle conflict, but I also learned that it made me feel downright awful. As a result, I've never used 'attack others' since.
          <p>
          Of course, if I could go back in time to that crisp 90s autumn day, I would have politely asked my future husband for an explanation as to why he was laughing so heartily with side-ponytail Suzy, but it's hard to imagine my 3rd grade self doing that.  Thank goodness I know better now though.
