          I learn best by asking questions -- but I learn a lot from other people's questions as well. If I have a question about something, there's a good chance you're not the only one out there.
          <p>
          The great thing (or terrible, depending on how you look at) about the internet is allows us to have and maintain a searchable record of questions and answers. In the case of programming, Stackoverflow is a great example of this. As I learn to code, I frequently have questions about how to do something, and, if you know what to search for, I'm almost always able to find answers there.
          <p>
          But looking at other people's questions and answers doesn't just teach me how to solve that particular problem -- it teaches me how to ask good questions.
          <p>
          From perusing Stackoverflow, there are two main takeaways I've learned for how to ask a good question:
          <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;1. Be Specific
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;2. Be Concise
          <p>
          Being specific is <em>especially</em> important when asking a programming question -- every little detail and punctuation mark is important, so being specific not only about your code, but what you're trying to achieve is key to a good question.
          <p>
          Being concise is important because it forces you to cut right to the heart of the manner and clear away unimportant details. People are also extremely busy, and are more likely to read/answer your question if it is short and easy to understand.
          <p>
          Of course, those two criteria can be applied to just about any kind of question, not just programming, but those are the key points I learned from Stackoverflow.
