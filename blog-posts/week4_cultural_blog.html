           Can We Get Some More Women In Tech Please?

          The image above is a screnshot from the fantastic tumblr <a href="http://femalesoftwareeng.tumblr.com/">Being a Female Software Engineer</a> which everyone should read at least once. Seriously, if you haven't seen it, go check it out. Now. Because as much progress as we've made in our society towards gender equality, let's face it. There are some fields out there that are still totally dominated by men.
          <p> I just came from one of them (Hollywood Talent Agencies, which are more specifically dominated by USC frat boys), and apparently I'm about to leap into another, according to this recent article from the New York Times,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0">Technology's Man Problem</a>.
          <p>According to the article, "In 2012, just 18% of computer-science college graduates were women," and over half of the women that go into technology currently end up leaving by mid-career. What in the world is going on here?
          <p>
          The article suggests that this is because the technology industry, as a whole, promotes a "sexist, alpha-male culture that can make women and other people who don't fit the mold feel unwelcome, demeaned, or even endangered." Of course there are happy exceptions to the rule, but the sheer abundance of material written on the tech world's "brogrammer culture" suggests that this is a very real problem. So how do we fix this?
          <p>The simplest answer is one that doesn't take a great deal of brain power to come up with -- <strong>get more women in technology</strong>. At my old company, the departments that had more women treated women better than the departments that didn't. It was that simple. Put more women in a company and the culture will change.  But geting more women in technology is a lot easier said than done.
          <p>
          There are a lot of programs out there now that are specifically designed to get young women interested in tech, like <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/programs/">Girls Who Code</a>, which offers Summer Immersion Programs to high school females in cities like Palo Alto, New York, Seattle and Boston. But these programs aren't big enough to make a huge impact. At least not yet.
          <p>Encouraging young women to pursue careers in technology at school and through programs like Girls Who Code is the first step. But technology companies also need to hire more women if we ever want to see change in the industry. Whether that means an official program for recruiting female employees, or that guiding more women towards a career in technology at an early age will naturally result in more women applying for tech jobs, <em>we need more women in technology.</em>
          <p>Because technology isn't just designed for men -- it's for everyone. So can we hurry up and get some more women in tech please?
